  The readers-writers problem is a classic synchronization problem in which two distinct classes of threads exist, reader and writer.
	 There also exists a shared memory segment called the 'critical section' which the reader and writer threads need to access.
	  These threads can exist simultaneously in the scenario. However, the writer threads must have exclusive access to the critical section.
	  
	The First Readers-Writers problem requires that no reader will be kept waiting 
	unless a writer has already obtained exclusive access to the shared object. 
	Hence, several readers can be reading together.
