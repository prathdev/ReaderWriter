In shared memory multiprocessor architectures, such as SMPs, threads can be used to implement parallelism. 
Historically, hardware vendors have implemented their own proprietary versions of threads, making portability a concern for software developers.

 For UNIX systems, a standardized C language threads programming interface has been specified by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c standard.
 
  Implementations that adhere to this standard are referred to as POSIX threads, or Pthreads.

    * The primary motivation for using Pthreads is to realize potential program performance gains.

    * When compared to the cost of creating and managing a process, a thread can be created with much less operating system overhead. 
    Managing threads requires fewer system resources than managing processes.
